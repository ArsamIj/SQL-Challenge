### Data Modeling, Data Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis
Using a Entity Relationship Diagram to devise the appropriate tables and connect them through relationship identifiers. Importing the data from csv files and creating queires that answer specific connection by connecting the datasets.

Using the created query options the following examples were acquired for combined dataset queries:
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
